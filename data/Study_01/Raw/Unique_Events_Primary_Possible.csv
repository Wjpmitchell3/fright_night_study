This was emotionally evocative because the strobe light and decreased visibility due to smoke really made me feel as if I was ""skipping frames"" in real life, and everyone time I saw a flash the person in front of me was in a different spot and the actors walking about appeared or vanished like that.  Also, there was one point where the line stopped for some reason and an actor bumped into me and apologized                          because he knew they were not allowed to touch us and kept saying he did not anticipate the line stopping like that.",Machine_Shop

It was emaciated like a skeleton and the torso was ripped a part. Toward the end, the last cell had an actual scare actor and he was dressed in black with a purple cape. He had black gloves on with these long nails/claws and he would walk around the cell looking at you as he grabbed the bars and screamed at you.
