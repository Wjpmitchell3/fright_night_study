I wasn't sure what he was saying at first, and I furrowed my brow as I leaned in to hear. His hair was cut short and it was black. He was generally colored monotone. He said something along the lines of ""... these next takes need to be PERFECT"" where he triggered a loud noise like air being released suddenly. He was pretending to be talking to actors before a shoot, I imagine. Walking in, we rounded a corner where a man dressed, equally in monotone but with bloodstains and as a journalist, was standing over some desks. There was some voiceover dialogue which he was mouthing, and he then stamped suddenly close to us while triggering that same, loud release of air. After that, I am less sure but I believe we walked past a woman dressed in red, smiling  who made no immediate effort to scare us. We walked into the next room, which seemed like rounding a grimy bathtub, and as we followed the path around, when we looked back towards the direction we had come, the woman in red triggered the loud air noise as she stepped into the room though a concealed curtain. Moving into the next room, there was what seemed to be a detective, very similar to the journalist but the entrance was facing him. After him, we walked past what seemed like a concierge, where a woman was sat rather calmly. She said something courteous as we walked past. I do not remember more.",,,,,,Man at Typewriter,Tub / Shower,Studio Mirror,Director's Chair,,,,,,1.514,603.009,628.802,36,"Waiting outside the machine shop was a large burly man with a huge hammer. He had a red jumpsuit on and was pacing back and forth by the entrance. Before we had gone in, here was a couple that asked whether they had to go up the stairs or to the left. The man remarked that it was hard to go through a gate unless you were a ghost. I didn't understand what they were talking about because I couldn't see past the entrance.  He paced some more and then yelled to everyone in the line that we should keep our faces covered as we entered, or else they would rip off anything they saw... lips, nose, heads maybe. Then one of his colleague, a woman equally with gory makeup, came to his side. She held an axe, and had another axe strapped to her right leg. She asked what limbs we wanted to give up before entering. I wanted to make a joke and raise my arm, but I didn't. No one else said anything before we were let in. I don't remember much about the shop itself, it all seems to blur. But I remember people with red jumpsuits being at our sides, holding axes or hammers. I was swearing a lot as people scared at me, and more than once the actors would say that I should watch my tongue or they would rip it out. There was a crushing machine with gore in it and someone escorting us into it. After that, there was a man on a scaffold that slammed it down as we walked below him. We then walked into a long passegway with fog and strobe lights. There was a small person running around us with a cog-styled-axe. At first he didn't speak, but then he said something I don't remember.",,,,,,Chainsaw,Air Gun,Table Saw with Hand,Walk Through Box,Gate Drop from Above,,,,,,0,0,44.774,0,0,0,7.645,0,,"The most emotionally evocative was the smashing machine. There was someone beside it saying about the smashing machine, but I didn't pay attention because it was dawning on me what the machine was, and I could see the gore as we entered the room. It was emotional for me because, more than anything else in the shop, this piece degraded humans into mush and goo, which is very striking for me. It truly got to the point where I was a little uncomfortable.",Unsettling,,"The gate drop. I was very startled by the noise, and impressed at the position, posture, and stance of the man at the top.

The man who greeted us mentioned the lady in red and told us that we were ""the stars of the show"" but to not tell us. It was a Hollywood movie themed set. There was a narration ongoing about a director as we walked. I remember there were a bunch of characters throughout. A receptionist, a director. I think there was a typewriter. Then there was the lady in red who was lounging on a chaise and she left in a huff, it was all very dramatic. There was a man at the end who was talking on the phone who was arguing with the caller about not telling visitors that the set was haunted as it was bad for business.

There was a dark passage with a bunch of obstacles with some green light we had to cross. The people who greeted us reminded me of Harley Quinn. There was paint splattered onto the walls. I don't think there was anyone who scared us like in the other houses. Just that there were a lot of situations that made me feel light headed. It was the first house we entered, after the introductions and rules section. Didn't seem very long.

I remember entering via a bus and that there was a man who was very scary in the bus. The bus was dark and there were a bunch of people sitting in the bus. One of these actors suddenly started getting up. Since it was dark and there was a strobing light effect I remember being super confused and scared. As we progressed into the house, there was a lady in front of our group who kept getting targeted and that was great for me because I was able to anticipate what was about to happen. There were a bunch of cages that had people who kept trying to escape. There were a lot of stairs and cages that kept shaking.",Bus,Jail Cells with Foliage / Nets,Character coming Between Jail Cell Grates,Floorboards Moves,Large Monsters over Railing,2.59,2.59,241.459,1,"There was a character at the beginning who was splitting groups up.

Towards the end of Delirium I circled back to the area with those two people dancing in some boxes before moving into another section of the tour.",Art Canvas,Get Glasses / Put on Glasses,Large Spiders,Polka Dots,Snake on Ledge,14.722,471.605,642.829,17,"The crypt was the last part of the tour. The crypt was a journey through some sort of mass burial area. It started with us walking into a bus with skeletons that had head wounds. I remember really being intrigued by the design of the skeletons and the lay out of the bus. Some time after we left the bus we walked through an area of cells containing robots in several grotesque and painful positions shaking and jerking violently. Here someone ran right through the cell and that really shook me because I thought all the cells were hard metal cages. There was also a box in a cage hat rattled and jerked towards the end of this section. Somewhere there were bodies hanging down from the ceiling as well and there was only one person in that section. There was a sliding floor section as well and that was unsettling just because of how unsafe it felt in an environment where you are already on your toes, trying to anticipate the next scare. There was also the the hall with the interesting portraits where there was a hole in the wall that someone popped their face out of. Very scary stuff ",Bus,Jail Cells with Foliage / Nets,Character coming Between Jail Cell Grates,Up the Stairs,Large Monsters over Railing,25.127,387.945,425.884,6,"Loud sounds, brutish movements and people cloaked in red overalls. I remember a big man running around with a chainsaw, lots of hissing and the clang of metal on metal. I remember thinking the sound design of the place was very good. We had to enter the tour individually and there was a red mist around the entrance. From the start I was very wary of dark corners because of how dark they seemed. Severally people appeared from those corners, sometimes they would charge rapidly then run right past or suddenly stop.

One of the first scenes was a woman in a red dress by a bed. I remember flashing lights and dark rooms. I want to say that there were hanging bodies that were dangling by chains. I remember in one of the later rooms, there was a big generator-looking machine. It was not really scary, just more dark and walking through various scenes. I also think there was a man in a white lab coat. I remember it feeling short in duration, like no more than 3 minutes and it was not that scary. ",Man at Typewriter,Tub / Shower,Studio Mirror,Lady in Red Robe,1.561,1.561,318.655,1,"This was the first section we went through. We were given white glasses that distorted our vision. The white glasses said Halloween Nights in black on the side. When we entered, we were met with an array of neon lights. I remember upon entrance to the first walkway, to the right, there was a window/mirror where I saw a scare actor in a colored afro scaring one of the other visitors and it was met with her scream. As we progressed, the walls were covered in neon colors and psychedelic patterns. It is also important to note that at the beginning of this section, there were two girls in red, white, and black outfits dancing on an elevated platform. Anyways, after the first walkway, we entered a tunnel that was blacked out and spinning with neon dots scattered throughout it. After this, there was one more walkway until it was over and I remember it being narrow. It was similar to the first walkway where the walls were bright and psychedelic. Right before we left, on the left near the entrance of the spinning tunnel that was next to where we exit, there was a large neon green pipe coming from the ground. I remember this being kinda disorienting but not very scary. Once we left, we walked past those dancing girls again and handed our glasses back to the guy working. More specifically, we put them in a black bucket. The person monitoring the collection of the glasses was in a dark suit with a hat and white makeup that made his face look emaciated. ",Splatter Paint,Get Glasses / Put on Glasses,Large Spiders,Polka Dots,Snake on Ledge,1.73,69.94,266.77,5,"I remember crypt being scary. I want to say that is the one where we had to enter through a bus. There was a worker monitoring our enterance and she was wearing a black cape with red underneath. The bus was short but it felt long. There was a fast flashing light that would completely blackout the bus every other second. There was mannequins dressed in scary costumes scattered on the bus seats meant to disguise scare actors that would jump out at you when you passed them. After leaving the bus, we entered the building where the next thing I remember is a blacked out hallway with people coming out and scaring us. They would blend in with dark corners. I also remember that there was a moving floorway at one point that we were unprepared for. In order to leave this part of the tour, we had to walk down one of the cellblocks where it was foggy and there were scare actors following us and making weird noises and jumping out at us. ",Bus,Jail Cells with Foliage / Nets,Bodies Hanging in Meat Freezer,Floorboards Moves,Large Monsters over Railing,1.443,1.443,246.944,1,"I remember Machine Shop being the scariest. I do not really remember the first half of the tour, but I want to say that we walked around this corner where I saw a painting that looked like someone screaming, but painted in what was supposed to be made to look like blood. I want to say we also had to walk up and down stairs toward the end. I also want to say that right before this, we had to walk through a forrest of cells with one of the first cells on the right being a fake prisoner coming out of a chamber thing. The next one on the left was a skeleton looking man in a suit on the ground with his torso all ripped apart. The last cell was a scare actor. It was on the left side. He was dressed in all black with a purple cape and he would walk around the cell making noises and screams. As we were walking around, he would reach out his hand where he had a glove on with sharp claws/nails. I remember that the woman before us was stopped because he reached his hand right in front of her face.

We entered with the direction of a scare actor who was wearing a black cape with red underneath. Upon entering, there was a quick flashing light that completely blacked out the bus every other second. There was mannequins dressed in scary costumes scattered throughout the bus in combination with actual scare actors. The first mannequin on the right I remember having long black hair draped in front of their face. As we walked through, I remember being scared that someone would grad my ankles. There was no one at the bus driver's spot. It was a short bus, only 5 or six rows. At the end, I remember there being screams from the scare actors trying to scare us. When you walked out the back of the bus, you had to walk through draping plastic. On the walkway out, I remember a scare actor behind a gate jumped against it to scare us. ",Eerie,"The second emotionally evocative event is when we had to walk through the hallway of cells. I remember that one of the first cells on the right had a dummy disguised as a prisoner halfway in a chamber. One of the next ones on the right had a dummy on the ground dressed as a man on the suit. It was emaciated like a skeleton and the torso was ripped a part. Toward the end, the last cell had an actual scare actor and he was dressed in black with a purple cape. He had black gloves on with these long nails/claws and he would walk around the cell looking at you as he grabbed the bars and screamed at you. He would also reach out and put his hand in front of you. When we were on the middle part of the cell that was protruding parallel to the wall, the woman in front of us got scared as the man put his gloved hand directly in front of her face. ",Intense,,(there is no Event 3 box shown to write what Event 3 is),"I remember that during the second section of the tour, I believe it was Trial 3, we walked into a dark bedroom with a woman in a red dress. I remember we had to walk around the bed and on the right side of the bed (if looking at the headboard from the foot of the bed) there was a brunette woman in a red dress with a black boa. She was talking distraughtly and you passed her as you were leaving. I want to say she was either on the verge of singing, or singing at some points. ",Weird,"The fifth event was when we were leaving the third section of the tour. In order to leave, we had to walk through the cell block while there was lights, fog, and scare actors hiding. You heard the scare actors but you couldn't see them. You also saw the exit at the end of the corridor and as you walked down, scare actors would be heard or would come up to you and scare you. I remember that right as I was walking out I heard a scare actor behind me try to scare me. ",Weary,"The sixth event was when we had to walk through this once cell block that was made to look like a forest. There were bodies wrapped in the leaves coming from the walls and some were wound in white cloth. At one point, there was a scare actor on the ground hidden in the rubble. Upon the exit, there were two bodies hanging over the exit, wrapped in the vines. There was also a scare actor hidden on the right side of this exit and I want to say that she was wearing a black cape. She had light hair and would move toward you as you went to exit.

There was a lady in a robe that was red and for some reason I remember seeing water fountains around. This exhibit was not very long, in fact it felt like the shortest one. We were walking around in very crammed spaces for most of it and I really don't remember it being that scary. I specifically remember one part of the tour where there was a makeshift dentist room and the actor had a drilll that he would move towards our faces when we walked by. I also remember the room with the lady in the red robe. She was in a bed in the middle of a dark room and that was the only thing in the room. That is all I can specifically remember.

There were ladies on these elevated surfaces in the beginning and I keep remembering this bright neon orange in the beginning. We walked through walls that were lit up neon. It was probably the brightest exhibit we went through. I don't remember anything about the actors. Just the walls I was seeing as I went through. The smoke that was being used was almost 3D in a way that I can't explain because of the glasses.

I rememebr being scared of the school bus because I thought someone was going to pop out at us while we were in there and it was a very small space. I remember there was a levitating box and someone was inside banging on it and it was so loud. At the end of this tour I remember being able to go one of two ways and the way we went took us through a hallway with a bunch of old jail calls that the prisoners used to live in. It was so dark inside each of them and they were so small. I remember that part because I remember also seeing these cells in parts of the machine shop tour and it was so dark I was nervous that there were actors in them that were going to pop out, but no one ended up popping out of them at us and most parts of the exhibit where cells were there were not decorations around them.

I was not that scared, but I think some people in the group were scared. I think it was a very low-key haunted section, definitely scarier than the delirium section but not the scariest section in there. yeah, that's pretty much all I've got, I assume it was a movie or film theme but beyond the camera dude, I don't remember any of the actors or their characters. ",Man at Typewriter,Tub / Shower,Studio Mirror,Lady in Red Robe,1.302,239.255,242.689,6,"ok so I truly dont remember delirium at all, I think it was a 3-D theme with a bunch of neon lights but why that was supposed to be scary who knows. I know a guy, in the beginning, tried to hassle us before giving us our 3-D glasses. and then we walked through the laser room which was one of the only truly scary parts of it. Then we walked through the actual section, and it was a bunch of 3-D walls and paint coming off the walls but it truly just looked like paintball gone wrong. There was a moving tunnel of LEDs, but only the walls were moving so it was probably supposed to be an optical illusion. I also remember the guy at the end asking us to throw our glasses away, but other than that stuff I can only picture the color of the LED paints but even that might be wrong but I think they were yellow, orange and pink",Splatter Paint,Two Characters Dancing on Raised Surface,Spinning Tunnel,Shaky Floor / Bridge,Snake on Ledge,0.909,232.292,241.349,10,"we walked through a bus, into a section with cages, past the handicapable ramp which I thought was great for accessibility. I was expecting someone to scare me on the bus but no one did so either the actors are unengaged or they were all mannequins. Also in this section, there was a room full of cages, with some guy hanging out of one trying to convince ppl he wasn't real but then he would scare them. and there was a guy on a landing above our heads banging on a cage as we walked under the doorway and it wasn't scary but I did think about the possibility that the cage would collapse on my head and I would die soooo. after we finished the crypt section we ran into the woman at the end who told us we could go down one way or the kaleidoscope hallway, and we went down the kaleidoscope hallway which wasn't scary at all.",Bus,Jail Cells with Foliage / Nets,Bodies Hanging in Meat Freezer,Floorboards Moves,Down the Stairs,2.598,227.74,243.466,9,"ok, so I was definitely the most scared during this section. within the first couple minutes of being in there, some actor came around a corner and jump scared me. I think the anticipation of waiting outside for a little bit added to the fear factor, not gonna lie. Then I think there was like a courtyard or at least tree and plant decorated area which another actor came out and scared me. And then I remember some actor blocking my path and not letting me go around the table and I was very angry and frustrated because he was determined to scare me however he was just extremely annoying and I think he said something along the lines of ""this is what happens when you don't follow the rules"" and overall it essentially ruined the rest of the section for me because I was so angry so that sucks, I think I remember some kind of red theme, maybe the lights or blood or costumes idk",Red Room,Air Gun,Table Saw with Hand,Body Parts Hanging,Long Hallway with Strobes,14.656,15.27,15.94,3,boredom,disappointment,,,,A lot,A moderate amount,,,,I did not attempt to change it,I did not attempt to change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,surprise ,coldness,embarassment,,,A lot,A little,A little,,,I did not attempt to change it,I attempted to reduce it,I did not attempt to change it,,,,I simply walked up the steps fast,,,,,A little  successful,,,,disgust ,,,,,A little,,,,,I did not attempt to change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,16.755,0,when the actor came up to me and blocked me from going around the table,path,"I was bored walking through the bus, I kept expecting something to happen",bus,,"um theres no options for event here, but i'll go with confusion",I was cold walking around outside the individual sections,outside,I was jealous walking by the fire pits with marshmallows because I was also very hungry,marshmellow,I was amused listening to the storyteller outside the sections with the audience just chilling in their chairs while he recited some random ghost story,storyteller,cold,bored,curious,,,A moderate amount,A moderate amount,A little,,,I attempted to reduce it,I did not attempt to change it,I did not attempt to change it,,,I walked faster and hugged myself,,,,,A little  successful,,,,,bored,disappointed ,,,,A moderate amount,A little,,,,I did not attempt to change it,I did not attempt to change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,confusion,,,,,A little,,,,,I did not attempt to change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,cold,tired,hungry,,,A moderate amount,A little,A lot,,,I did not attempt to change it,I did not attempt to change it,I did not attempt to change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,hunger,jealousy,,,,A lot,A little,,,,I did not attempt to change it,I did not attempt to change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,amusement,,,,,A little,,,,,I did not attempt to change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes, I have a smartphone with me.",iPhone,13,3,"Instagram,Facebook,Snapchat,Tiktok,YouTube,Pinterest",1-2 hours,,Rarely ever used,1-2 hours,1-2 hours,2-3 hours,,,10-20 minutes,,5-10 times per day,,Never,5-10 times per day,2-4 times per day,2-4 times per day,,,Once per day,,About every 15 minutes,100,115,60,A few times a month,I rarely post personal updates,Most of the time; I wish I did it less,Most of the time; I wish I did it less,3-5 hours,Strongly Agree,Agree,Weakly Agree,Disagree,Agree,Weakly Disagree,Weakly Disagree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,6,10,SOCIAL,27,6,UTILITIES ,5,16,TRAVEL,2,40,OTHER,2,12,PRODUCTIVITY AND FINANCE,1,33,93,187,A little,A lot,Very fearful,A little fearful,Not at all fearful,Not at all fearful,Not at all vivid,A little fearful,Not at all vivid,Moderately fearful,A little vivid,Not at all vivid,Dislike a little,Like a moderate amount,No,,No,,79,89,53,48,2,20,20,A little

Afterwards, we came into another room with two dancing figures on boxes, and one figure giving out 3D glasses. She ran out before me and the last member in our line could walk past, so we had to wait a moment. Afterwards, and upon putting on the 3D glasses, we came into several narrow, neon passageways.

The lady ushering us in told the two men behind us that they could not carry drink into the section. Climbing into the bus, you immediately notice the figures slumped onto the windows of the bus as strobe lights flash, giving you the barest glimpses of their presence. I thought that at any moment, one of them was going to startle us, I even kept turning around to make sure they hadnât moved. As we exited the bus, there was a loud rattling noise. I didnât see the man that did it, but as I walked past I saw him. I think he was old and bearded and was making the noise by dragging something rapidly across a laminated sheet. I yelled âWhat are you doing?!â In surprise and he responded with something like âScaring you!â. After that, I remember a long passageway intercepted by cages and others, curtained passages. There were people with cloaks and demon-like masks. Being at the end of the line, the demons were walking behind me, and one of them decided to follow me ominously through the entirety of the tour. I remember that they and the other people in the group could choose to pass through the curtained passages to keep going.

He was then joined by a woman with two axes, on strapped to her right leg. She asked who of us wanted to volunteer a limb. The man in front of us asked whether or not they should go up the stairs, and the man with the hammer said the only way to go through the gate that led to the stairs was to be a ghost. I had not noticed the gate until we were being ushered in. In the tour itself, I remember going past several machines, with people in red jumpsuits yelling at us. There was the arm in the machine with a woman yelling at us, then a man by a machine which I do not remember, but I do remember the man said he would rip my tongue out if I didnât mind my language, and the crushing machine.

There was a dirty bathtub when we first walked in and most of the people in the place were dressed like doctors and dentists. They were holding surgical tools and standing in front of patient chairs. They also had clear masks so you could see their face. There was a lady who sang and screamed a lot and she was in one room with a mirror and small bed and then she moved to another section of the room that had a vanity and some lighting around it. I remember there were some tables that looked like operating tables. This was the least scary out of the 4 and no one was screaming or following you. It also looked like an abandoned hospital or asylum. ,Man at Typewriter,Tub / Shower,Studio Mirror,Lady in Red Robe,2.31,2.31,242.619,1,I think this was the first section of the haunted house and we got 3d glasses for it. It was very bright because the walls were drawn or painted on with neon markers. I only remember a few actors coming up and scaring us and it was more just seeing decorations that made it look scary. There was a spinning tunnel and with the glasses it made it hard to walk because i remember saying its like walking with those drunk goggles. It was a short walkthrough but there were a lot of things to look at that made it kind of scary. ,Splatter Paint,Two Characters Dancing on Raised Surface,Large Spiders,Polka Dots,Snake on Ledge,5.694,5.694,254.724,1,We started by lining up to go into a bus and i remember it being scary because there were a lot of fake bodies and since it was dark i couldnt tell if they were real or not. There was one real person in the back row and she jumped out at us and followed behind us until we exited. There was an area with cages and vines and a green light and the people in the cages came out and walked behind us and tried to scare us a few times. There was also a section of walking through a pitch black hallway and there were actors along the path who would come up and scare us. There was also an area with a picture frame that fell every few seconds and a person would jump out. There was a hallway with moving panels on the floor. There was also a freezer with fake hanging bodies and an actor inside with a hammer or chainsaw. The freezer was hard to see cause there was a strobing light so it was hard to make out what was happening. ,Bus,Loud Box inside of Jail Cell,Character coming Between Jail Cell Grates,Up the Stairs,Large Monsters over Railing,5.377,162.929,242.193,5,We had to enter small groups at a time and I remember hearing loud noises. There was a person hiding behind a corner of the entrance and scaring people. People had chainsaws and hammers and i remember someone turning on the chainsaw and it was very loud. I remember them dressing like mechanics and talking about spare parts. There were areas that had smoke and green lights which made it hard to see. I remember this being the scariest of the four sections. I think there were also people behind bars that would walk next to us and make noises at us. ,Chainsaw,Air Gun,Table Saw with Hand,Body Parts Hanging,Long Hallway with Strobes,8.699,8.699,16.513,1,nervous,anxious,,,,A lot,A moderate amount,,,,I did not attempt to change it,I attempted to reduce it,,,,,By trying to look ahead and be prepared for what came after we exited the bus. ,,,,,Moderately successful,,,,Shock,Fear,anxious,,,A lot,A lot,A lot,,,I did not attempt to change it,I did not attempt to change it,I did not attempt to change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fear,,,,,A lot,,,,,I attempted to reduce it,,,,,I tried to get out of the freezer before the actor could chase after me. ,,,,,A little  successful,,,,,17.386,17.386,17.794,1,In the first section there was an area with fake spiders hanging over us and i remember getting very nervous because i am very scared of spiders. ,Spider,The tunnel in the first section because it was very hard to walk and i think someone in my group got chased or fell down in the tunnel because we had to wait for him to catch up. ,Tunnel,The chainsaw turning on in the machine shop section.

The scene was set up to look like a 1940s or 1950s abandoned office, with old style telephones and posters. The actors were wearing old costumes too, like pants and collared shirts with suspenders, but their faces were painted to look skeleton-like. I remember a man sitting in a chair reading a newspaper, and I think there was music from a gramophone playing. There was one point when we walked past a woman with brown hair wearing a dress, pearl necklace, and feather boa. She was in a vanity area with a mirror and shade and was singing opera.

It was extremely dark and there was a mix of real and fake people in the seats. Then we went into a caged area outside where we could see the Blood Lounge and actors scared us from outside the cage. We then went inside and weaved through a maze of cages. The actors mostly had these dead-gray masks on, but some just had faces painted. The actors would follow us and pop out from behind the bars of the cages. At one point there was a man hanging from some bars, and then a woman laughing and following us. The ceiling had what looked like plant material hanging from it. There was one cage that had a box that was hanging by chains and would periodically shake and flash. There was a part when we walked through and area with strobe lights and a man got right up in my face. There was also a part when the flood was sliding as you walked along it. At another time we walked up a set of stairs and there were large hanging reapers from the ceiling above the cage maze area. We walked up another set of stairs and ended on an area with a long hallway where people with plague masks were scaring us.

There was a stage with a man with skeleton face paint and a clear face shield, and the walls had been covered with a gray wallpaper. The lighting was dim and had a slight orange tint to it. The woman making the announcement was wearing a Victorian-era looking dress and top hat and was holding a cane. There were also skulls around the room and torches too I believe. I remember her making comments about ""we won't bite"" and the safe word to get out being ""Be nice, ghoul"". They also offered the red glow sticks if we wanted a more intense experience, which I did and wish I had taken! Needless to say I was excited and intrigued about what was to come.",Intrigued,"In Delirium, I remember first stepping into the area with my 3D glasses on and thinking how strange and also cool the scenery was. Everything was distorted and coming out towards me. I was putting my hands out trying to feel for where exactly the walls, pipes, and props started. The neon colors only added to the strangeness of it all. It had been years since I had worn 3D glasses and was not used to it.",Strange,,Scared,"At the beginning of the crypt, I saw we were entering a bus and was excited but a bit nervous. It was dark inside so I couldn't see anything that offered any hints as to what could be inside. Once we were allowed in, we walked up the steep 2-3 steps into the bus, which was practically pitch black. The lights may have been flashing a bit, though that could have been light seeping in from the windows. The freakiest part was that most of the people sitting on the school bus seats were just dummies, but the space between us and them as we walked down the middle aisle was so small that I was very worried one of them would pop up right in my face. I was glad to be directly behind someone for this part. The only real actor I saw was towards the back left, and they had on one of those dead gray masks. They were already in another person's face ahead of me, though, so I knew their location and wasn't as nervous after that. ",Nervous,"Also in the crypt, in the jail cell maze, there was a point when we passed an actor who was literally hanging from the bars/perched on one of the cells in the air. That was freaky because they were RIGHT up at my face level, on my right side. I was very worried it would touch me. I had to turn my face away and cower into my roommate to the left to avoid making eye contact with it. It didn't try anything luckily, just made a growling noise. Right after that was when we ran into the crazy lady and the hanging flashing box.",Worried,"The scariest thing that happened for me was in the meat locker in the Crypt. We walked into this big room where strobe lights were flashing and I could barely see. There was a wall to our left and bodies hanging in bags from meat hooks to our right. I can only remember seeing one actor in that room, but he was in the far right corner when we walked in and suddenly was right up in my face when we stepped into the middle of the room.

I remember trying to grab onto the seats to my left and right in the bus to make sure I was walking in the correct direction. I did not like this feeling of not knowing where you step next.

There were not that many jump scares. We saw people dressed as ""performers/ actors"" preparing to go on stage. There was not blood or chainsaws or anything like that, it was more so creepy than scary. They were back stage waiting to go onstage. There was one woman whose room had a makeup area and a director chair and that is the one particular scene that I remember clearly.

The were pretend bodies in the bus seats as well as real ones, and it was hard to differentiate between the two. We got off the bus and went into the main room where we started on the bottom floor and had to go up and down two separate flights of stairs throughout this room. There was lots of blood and chainsaws and other machinery like that. This room was more gory than the rest. It was on and off dark with strobe lights and there was the meat packing room with different pretend bodies hanging from the ceiling as well as real people, and it was also difficult to differentiate between the two because of the flashing strobe lights. There was also an instant where the floor began to move and walking became difficult. At the very end we walked up a flight of stairs and down a long hallway and it was almost impossible to see because of the constant flashing strobe lights.

This room had a person chasing other people with a chainsaw and the people in this room were a lot bloodier and scarier than others. This room was also very dark and was sometimes difficult to see. I specifically remember being chased by a man with a chainsaw and I also remember another person with an axe-like type of tool.

There were jail cells on either side that were very small. I remember better now. There were a lot of strobe lights, I was having trouble following the group ahead. The hallway was narrow and I was losing my balance. There were a few tall clowns. That were in orange. White strobe lights. I remember seeing the silhouete of my female peer ahead of me, her long hair. We turned a few corners. Actors jumped out at the corners. There were some uneven platforms that we had to be balanced on. WAIT I REMEMBER NOW. It was sort of 1920s gangster theme. There was a guy ina suit sitting on a table ina gangster sort of suit that said something along the lines of  ""Keep your eyes out theres something weird thats going on"".

There were a lot of middle school aged children behind us. There was a clown actor that kept telling our research coordinator to close his laptop and put it away. We stepped up onto the school bus, and there was a dummy woman in the first seat on the left.  There were a variety of actors vs dummies in the seats. There were flashing white lights. We were then led into the penitentiary building. There again we walked through a hallway that included the jail cells that were narrow and the long tall narrow hallway. There were tall demonic monsters in the hallway that were above the grassy viney hallway. there was a grassy viney sort of hallway that we walked through. That had chains and a lot of body dummies in a pile. There was an arm in one of the body piles that kept swirling around. It was confusing to look at.

",,bus,"the second evocative event was seeing the two large demonic looking figures that were hanging from the cieling in the main penetentiary hallway  wherethe jail cells were. they had long saggingrags on their bodies and long hands fingers i believe. Big heads. they were silhouetted by the lights below them and no lightsabove them. UNDErneath them was the netted area with foliage and chains and cages with piles of body parts in them. I liked the composition of the scene, I thought it looked rather pretty in addition to it feeling rather eerie, chilly, spooky. Crawling on my spine feeling.

There was a room with a dentist in it I think asking us to come back so he could take care of our teeth. There was a ""Star Diva"" vanity thing that had a mirror and chair set up. After that, there was a room with a man and a chair that looked like it came from either a dentists office or something like an OR. The chair had a skull on it and the man was saying something along the lines of, ""This is all I have of my actress, please let me have you"" or something like that. Basically saying he was gonna kill us and harvest us for parts for his actress.

There were special glasses provided for us to make things 3D. There were a lot of fun clowns and dancers when we walked in. I don't know what to call it, but there was a tunnel and a little bridge through it and the tunnel walls were rotating around us like washing machine which made it very difficult to walk through because it looked like the room/tunnel was spinning.

One of them said A+ was their favorite blood type. The line led to a bus that was dark and had a strobe light on it. There were fake dead bodies in the seats of the bus. Outside the bus and around a corner, there was a scare guy hiding between two chain link fences and he jumped up at the people behind us. The inside of the attraction was really dark and there were a bunch of dead bodies hanging from the ceiling. There were actors who would jump from in between jail bars at us. There was a ""freezer"" that had whole dead bodies hanging from it and there were crazy strobe lights in it as well. There was also a scare actor hiding amongst the bodies that was reaching out at us. I ran into the last body because I couldn't see from the strobe lights. Outside the freezer there were moving floor boards. I think there were three or four of them that shifted in every direction.

She told groups more than two to stand in line smallest to tallest so she knew where to chop us. I was freaking out a little because we did not get in line smallest to tallest and I was at the back so I thought I wasn't going to be allowed in. She also said a really funny joke something like, ""If you have to ask if someone is around the corner, there is."" and it was just so deadpanned that it was funny. Anyway, we went in and it was really dark inside. I was looking around every single corner for someone. There were machine parts and actors were showing us the way through. It also happened to be in the death row portion of the prison which I thought was cool in kind of a twisted way. But there was a big circuit board kind of thing in the beginning before we were led outside and then back inside. There were people with mallets or hammers or something that would swing at me and then stop before they hit and honestly, I think I was being targeted because that happened like six times throughout the night. I think there were body parts hanging along the wall and ceiling in this one too. There were a bunch of machinery props out and about too. We eventually were led into The Machine, I guess it was called, and it was just this big box that kind of shook a little bit. It was very anticlimactic for sure. There was a girl outside of it that said something about having all the parts in the machine. And then I think that was the end of the section.

",Club,"Waiting in line for Machine Chop, the actor outside, character named Bunny, was telling us to get into a single file line, tallest to smallest, for groups bigger than two (our group) and we didn't, I assume because she recognized Steven, and I was real concerned that we might get separated. ",Bunny,"I can't remember which section this occurred in, somewhere between Machine Chop and The Crypt I believe, we were walking down a very long hallway and there were, again, intense strobe lights going on, and an actor came up behind me and growled in some crazy weird way that apparently every actor knew how to do and said, ""The ones at the back are easier to attack."" which was a very astute observation actually.

The next room had a woman with a long red robe, startling people by singing very loudly. She would walk between rooms by a trick door disguised as a vanity table. This attraction also had a dentist with a power drill standing by an old school dental chair. One actor was also standing behind a concierge desk with a land line, talking to a skull. ",Man at Typewriter,Tub / Shower,Water Fountain,Lady in Red Robe,13.741,13.741,245.316,1,"Delirium was the first event of the night. It started by going into an art studio w/ neon lights and one actor painting on the canvas. Then we walked into a room with two go-go dancers on black boxes wearing black and white dresses and men in clown makeup. There were neon lights and colors. Then they gave us 3-D glasses to wear and we walked through a tunnel with moving walls that made you dizzy. Then we continued to walk through neon colored rooms with actors wearing bright colors and clown makeup. At one point we walked over a snake bridge, but I am unsure at what point we did that. At the end of the attraction there were two more go-go dancers on black boxes wearing black and white polka dot dresses.

In the bus their were dolls and mannequins sitting in the seats. The bus was also filled with fog. Towards the end of the bus was an actor sitting still waiting for us to approach so he could jump up an scare us. After we got off the bus, there were jail cells with foliage and dirt covering them with skulls and debris on the ground around them.  There were actors in black capes with white masks positioned around the cells and bars. There was also a large metal box with an animatronic figure inside, thrashing violently. ",Bus,Jail Cells with Foliage / Nets,Character coming Between Jail Cell Grates,Floorboards Moves,Large Monsters over Railing,2.446,326.356,350.625,8,"Before even entering the machine shop, there was an actress controlling the lines who put us into height order (shortest to tallest) before walking through. In this attraction, there were long dark hallways with a red hue and a bald actor with a hatchet who would run up and scare you. The walls were often lined with bloody limbs. Their were actors in red jump suits that would walk up behind you and scare you.

She would move from room to room by a false door that looked like a vanity table. I thought this was an interesting character.  ",Entertaining. ,"In the first attraction, Delirium, the actors gave us 3-D glasses and we walked over a bridge with turning cylinder walls. This was incredibly disorienting and I had to close my eyes at one point while walking over the bridge cause I thought I was going to fall. ",Disorienting,"There was a man in the Take 13 attraction, standing behind a concierge desk talking to a skull through a phone. He was arguing with the skull about accommodations. It was a silly and fun aspect of this section. ",Silly,"In the attraction, Delirium, the first room/actors we saw were two dancers on black boxes wearing black and white go-go dancing dresses.

The art was reminiscent of a comic or superhero series. There was a woman dancing on the table, and loud music and popping sounds (sorry I am having trouble typing lol) The most notable experience was this tunnel where the walls kept rotating, and as we tried to traverse it, you felt dizzy. The tunnel was dark, and there was neon dots/spots that were disorienting since everything was moving. That was pretty dope.

Thumping sounds came from within, which as a little freaky tbh. It was soon our turn to board, and we ascended some stairs to go into the bus. There were flashing lights and motionless figures, heads down, hair covering their faces, sitting in the seats. I tried to leave as quickly as possible, praying none of them would jump out. We then entered a different room. For some reason I'm totally blanking on what happens next? I'm not sure, but I think several creepy figures followed us as we entered a series of small rooms. I think I remember some dismembered body parts, smoky rooms, and loud popping sounds. I also remember some people/figurines in cages, people who'd come out from around dark corners, and I think we went upstairs at one point too. The floors would be moving and there'd be more jump scares. I'm not 100% sure if I'm confusing this with another section of the tour, tbh? There were also some hanging plants/cloth from the ceiling.

There was no driver, or at least a plexiglass was shielding him. The bus was dark, and there was flashing white light at a rapid interval. Figures were bent, heads down, one on every over row/seat or so. None of them lunged, thankfully, but I made my way through the aisle as quickly as possible. We descended the ramp and left the bus.",,Ominous,"The hallway of cages: we wandered through a dark, foggy room/hallway populated with small cages. Inside were zombie looking patients, someone wrapped in white cloth and sitting up, and a figure with an arm poking out of its chest. There were things hanging from the ceiling, and people who'd occasionally chase me or try and scare me. There was also a box that would rattle. We finally left that room. ",,Mysterious,"The rattling floors: I remember climbing the stairs and seeing a sign warning of rattling floors/flashing lights. We climbed some stone stairs and entered this narrow hallway, where the floor's sliding panels would occasionally shift, making it hard to walk.

I think the actor there said something about teeth so i think it was a creepy dentists office. The path was sorta thin and zig zagged into different rooms.

Definitely seemed like she'd delt with that a few too many times that day. Anyways, the line was long and swung by the potta porties. there was a man with a whale shirt in front of us in line. The lady who let us in had a cool outfit, a shaved head, and some sort of large prop tool in her hand. I think this was one of the medium scary ones. tbh I remember more from outside of it, then from inside. I don't think there were too many actors in this one. Maybe one jump scare.

And while I was focused on how to avoid the bodies I was aware that there was a live actor near me. I think they could tell I was uneasy and he got in my ear and started growling.I laughed/screamed and I remember regretting it because I knew he would follow me and he did.

We walked past her, but she came around a second corner and flipped her large fan open with a loud noise.

Once we walked through the cage room, there was a very dark room with bodies hanging upside-down from chains in the ceiling.

moveable floorboards which was kinda cool. we walked thru the caged hallway and then the thing ended,Bus,Loud Box inside of Jail Cell,Bodies Hanging in Meat Freezer,Up the Stairs,Large Monsters over

The main thing I remember is the man reenacting a news real and him scaring the living crap out of us as we walked by. He did a really good job staying in character and looking directly into the camera as if he was actually being filmed. Another highlight that really stood out was the woman in the room after the cameraman. She seem to be having some sort of panic attack about what she wants to wear to her event. Immediately after I remember seeing the woman put make up on her face and being very concerned on the way that she looked. This was very scary because she kept looking at me through the mirror as she was putting make up on. The entire vibe and this take 13 was my favorite of the entire experience strictly because it matched the vibe of the eastern state penitentiary so well. ,Man at Typewriter,Tub / Shower,Studio Mirror,Directorâs Chair,1.299,1.299,241.004,1,The very first thing I remember with delirium was the room where we first walked in. The green light that was waist high and the smoke with hands coming out from underneath it was very scary and did not expect any of that. After that I remember walking through a circular shape the room as it looked like it was spinning clockwise. From there I remember walking through a clown room that was very scary. The smoke was also very disorienting as I was getting a little confused on where to go. This also was really tough to see exactly the corners and where characters would be popping up. ,Splatter Paint,Get Glasses / Put on Glasses,Spinning Tunnel,Polka Dots,Return Glasses,2.302,217.427,240.917,15,The crypt was very spooky and the first thing I remember was a lot of smoke and tombstones. Another big highlight was the eerie music that was playing in the background. It was also quite dark and remember being in the back of the line and people following me. I was quite nervous that they would sneak up on me and scare me even more since I was in the back. I also remember hearing soft screams in the background. The fake smoke was also very disorienting.

And houses in the past have always scared me most with a chainsaw. I knew that was going to be the scariest moment for me especially when he started to reach 4 feet with the chainsaw. I also remember there being a lot of banging of metal and loud noises. Walking through a couple rooms there was a man with a hammer banging it on a metal table and screaming at us as he was doing so. This was the most disturbing because I couldnât hear myself think as he was doing so. The hostess letting us in before we went in was also very scary and intriguing. The first thing I remember was her eyes and how great of a character she was playing as a scary guard. As soon as we walked in there were these cell looking rooms where people would lunge out behind the bars and try to grab us. This was by far one of the scariest starts to the the house that we entered.

Then when we walked into the first room it was gray and there was a man standing behind a desk at the other corner of the room.  It was almost like a monochromatic scene, there was an announcement being played on a loudspeaker that he was mouthing (but not saying himself).  There was also a typewriter on the desk in front of him and he was smacking some metal object to jump scare people.  After leaving that room and entering the other there was a woman in a red dress singing opera music and she was going back and forth between that room and another.  We had to walk around her cage in the center.  I do not recall anything off the top of my head after this.  I think there may have been a dentist chair and a head with a bunch of teeth all over it in this section but am not entirely sure when or where it was in relation to the others, or if it was even in ""Take 13"".",Man at Typewriter,Dentist Chair,Studio Mirror,Lady in Red Robe,2.953,2.953,275.82,1,"Delerium was the first Section of the tour I believe.  The first thing I remember was walking through a section that was almost like a ballet studio, there were bright neon lights/lasers shining back and forth, it was a smoke filled room with the layer falling just above an arm rest, and there were mirrors on either side.  After walking through there I remember walking through a room where people kept running past us on either side.  Then, I remember being handed 3D glasses and going through a section that again was filled with very bright neon colors with pictures and objects that popped off the walls even more.  There was a large spider on the wall somewhere in that section.  At the end we walked through a tube that was spinning on a platform that was slanted making it very difficult to walk.  I felt dizzy and as if the platform (bridge) was shaking a little.  I thought I was going to fall over.",Splatter Paint,Two Characters Dancing on Raised Surface,Large Spiders,Polka Dots,Snake on Ledge,9.267,9.608,259.365,2,"The Crypt I remember walking into and seeing the X and thinking it was going to be very scary, but ended up not being as scary as the other section of the tour marked X, I forget the name of that one but think it was the Wood Shop or something like that.  Anyways with the Crypt I don't remember too too much unfortunately, I think the other sections stood out a little more.  I think with the Crypt the memories I have are as follows:  there was a room that we entered that was bright and gory, had bodies hung upside down that were moving.  I also remember going up and down floors in the Crypt which was unique compared to the other sections.  One section we went through was a cell block and I remember a box flashing with bright lights and banging around as if something was in it, all inside a cage to the right of the tour, as well as an air blast cannon that hit around my right calf.  There was also a guy running back and forth through the cell's bars which I was kind of amazed as to how he fit through while running so fast, thinking if it were me I'd get stuck or bang my head going through which made me laugh a little.   ",Bus,Loud Box inside of Jail Cell,Bodies Hanging in Meat Freezer,Up the Stairs,Large Monsters over Railing,3.672,340.247,340.707,5,"The Machine Shop was the scariest I felt.  I remember first walking in and a character swinging a sledge hammer at my girlfriend who was in front of me.  I remembered this most because I was genuinely concerned something was going to happen and I was going to be stepping in.  It was also a shock because I don't remember anything the character looked like outside of a black figure and the sledgehammer.  Afterwards we continued through and I could smell gasoline/exhaust fumes of what I believed to be a chainsaw (I got this from my background with this).  Immediately after smelling this we stepped outside and a shorter woman bent over came running up the ramp towards the inside revving a chainsaw.  Afterwards we continued on back inside of another building and I remember walking around and through some box where a guy scared us in then came right back around and scared us coming out.  I remember this cause again, it was a jump scare right in my girlfriend's face so I thought I was going to get defensive and then the character started laughing saying ""I got you didn't I"" and she responded ""yeah you did"" and he kept repeating this and them going back and forth saying he really got her and she said yes you did.  Then there was also a table saw somewhere in this section where someone's hand had been chopped off.  I remember it being the darkest overall of the exhibits in terms of lighting throughout, if there was any light at all it was a pale white LED rather than bright lights like delirium, golden lights like in Take 13, and a mixture of both golden lights with just more colorful content (i.e. gory blood-soaked or items, people, etc.) throughout the Crypt.",Chainsaw,Air Gun,Table Saw with Hand,Body Parts Hanging,Long Hallway with Strobes,0,0,17.564,0,Anger,Concern,Defense,Fear,Frustration,A great deal,A great deal,A great deal,A lot,A lot,I attempted to reduce it,I attempted to reduce it,I attempted to reduce it,I attempted to reduce it,I attempted to reduce it,I kept reminding myself that these were all actors and that any tools/props they used they would use in a way that would not cause harm to anyone.,"Similar to above, I kept reminding myself that the sledgehammer was probably modified and did not carry the weight a real sledgehammer carries and would not physically cause harm to my girlfriend.","As stated, reminding myself this was a controlled environment and an actor that has done the same thing many times before calmed my sense to react and defend my girlfriend.",I used the term fear in relation to concern as I was fearful that the sledgehammer was going to cause injury to my girlfriend.

As such, the smell of gasoline and exhaust fumes are what I equate to morning shift change so by thinking of this it make me feel more comfortable of my surrounding, and also expect the actual chainsaw to follow.","As mentioned above, I equated this to shift change at the firehouse so I focused on reminiscing my most recent shift and going through that morning routine.

It was a bit unexpected and probably stood out because we had just entered from the monochromatic newsroom with an announcement from a man with a relatively deep voice into this room that was dark but still had a gold light and woman in a red flowing dress singing opera.",Dress,"I did not know if this was part of one of the sets but I would be remiss if I did not mention it.  This is the long tunnel that we entered before the Shop set.  This was emotionally evocative because the strobe light and decreased visibility due to smoke really made me feel as if I was ""skipping frames"" in real life, and everyone time I saw a flash the person in front of me was in a different spot and the actors walking about appeared or vanished like that.  Also, there was one point where the line stopped for some reason and an actor bumped into me and apologized                          because he knew they were not allowed to touch us and kept saying he did not anticipate the line stopping like that.",Hallway,In the Crypt after we had walked upstairs there was a section that had a bridge/platform that reminded me of one of those speed-walker flat escalators you see at the airport that help you go from one section to another faster.  This stood out because I remember being on it and thinking of the scene Elf where Will Ferrell does his split on the escalator which made me laugh.  But at the same time I thought I was going to fall over on this thing and been embarrassed because my girlfriend would have thought it to be the funniest thing in the world.  Plus there was a group of random people behind me (I was the last in our study group line) so I was concerned they would laugh and/or fall  on top of me.,Falling,"In the Crypt when we got to the cell block that hanging box with the flashing bright blue/green/white light caught my attention.

Then towards there end there was a cool section that was like a u shaped hallway. In this section someone stood behind a sliding window, the actor would slam the window down and scream. At the end of the u the floor slid back and forth. The end of this section was a hallway like the one with the strobe lights but there were no actors and no strobe lights.

There were people dressed up as characters doing different kinds of commercials. At the beginning, an actor said into a speaker that a doctor was missing. Some commercials were for soap and toothpaste. There was a lady in a long red dress sitting on a chair. There were posters on the walls that were part of it but I couldn't stop to read them.

The person at the very beginning made a very loud banging noise. There was a ""meat locker"" section where fake bodies were hanging from the ceiling and I was afraid of touching one. We went up some stairs and there was a long, twisty, maze-like section with lots of cages and real people and automatons within the cages. Some of the automatons were waving, while others were having their heads chopped up or something else grotesque. We were waiting by one particular cage for a while and the actor was running back and forth hissing. He saw one person had their mask off and told them to put it back on. We went down some stairs and up others. There was a moving floor.

I remember walking past a woman on the phone twirling her hair and that there were many posters and other movie set like props around. I remember one of the actors scaring the girl in front of me and then walking through a room with a bed and a lady singing and swinging out her fan very fast to scare people. I believe that room was called the Diva. I remember not thinking it was very scary or that the actors werenât jumping at people very much like in the other rooms. ,Man at Typewriter,Dentist Chair,Studio Mirror,Directorâs Chair,1.92,396.584,396.932,10,I remember Delirium being our first section so I was a little nervous going into it because I had never been to a haunted house. I remember walking in and they handed us glasses to wear.  There was neon paint and two actors acting like mental patients painting. There was neon paint that felt like it was jumping out at me because of the 3D glasses which was disorienting to me. I had to take them off a handful of times just to prevent getting dizzy or knocking into something. I remember some of the actors looked like clowns. I also remember large neon spiders on the walls ,Art Canvas,Get Glasses / Put on Glasses,Large Spiders,Polka Dots,Snake on Ledge,5.632,558.468,559.124,11,"I remember being in line and noticing this line was longer than other as well as taking mental note of the red X at the sign for the crypt. Once we started the section we walked through a grey prison bus. The lights were flashing and i remember seeing bodies in the seats. I remember being nervous the bodies would jump at me and I was trying to see if they were props or actors but it was so hard to see. I then remember walking through a few different rooms, one had a shifting floor and I had to walk up and down stairs. I remember walking through a room with many cages with foliage and vines all around. There were a few actors scaring people and myself and I was stopped for a little next a loud banging box and the sound was scary/unsettling to me. I then remember going to a freezer room with bodies hanging from the ceiling. Again the lights were flashing and it was very dark so it was hard to see and I was scared of knocking into one of the âbodiesâ or the scare actor that was in the room. He came up on my side and growled in my ear. I remember screaming and regretting it because since he got a reaction out of me he would follow me. I kept looking straight focusing on making my way out of the room without bumping into him or the prop bodies but he scared me again before I left the room. ",Bus,Jail Cells with Foliage / Nets,Character coming Between Jail Cell Grates,Floorboards Moves,Large Monsters over Railing,63.569,277.422,278.901,5,I remember it was the first section we went to that had a red X. People in line seemed a little more nervous which probably made me anticipate more scares. Two young girls who went in in front of us ran out to take their glow necklaces off- indicating they didnât want any extra scares. There was as a scare actor at the entrance that was separating groups but knew we were part of the study and mentioned something to us about it. I then remember lots of chain saw sounds and body parts. I donât remember many of the specific rooms but I could hear people in front of me screaming so I felt like I was anticipating a lot. ,Chainsaw,Air Gun,Table Saw with Hand,Body Parts Hanging,Long Hallway with Strobes,4.128,15.961,16.701,3,scared ,nervous ,,,,A great deal,A lot,,,,I attempted to reduce it,I did not attempt to change it,,,,Tried to breathe through it and not scream or react. ,,,,,A little  successful,,,,,Disgusted ,,,,,A little,,,,,I did not attempt to change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,jittery ,,,,,A moderate amount,,,,,I did not attempt to change it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.281,26.046,26.738,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
