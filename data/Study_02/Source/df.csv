PLEASE NOTE: Your participation is limited strictly to Surveys. You will not be asking to complete any parts of this study in-person or complete any behavioral tasks or fMRI imaging.","Two popular emotion regulation strategies are REAPPRAISAL and DISTRACTION



Reappraisal involves thinking about the unwanted emotional experience or object in such a way to change its emotional meaning. When reappraising. we change the way we think about the experience or object such that it alters the emotional reaction to it. For example, in the context of a haunted house, you could make an effort to remind yourself that the people are just actors who are using props, rather than zombies trying to hurt you. 



Distraction involves looking at or thinking about something besides the unwanted emotional experience or object. Again, in the context of a haunted house, you could choose to look down at your feet or think about what you ate for lunch rather than focusing on the zombies coming after you.","Before we begin, one last reminder of the definition of each strategy:

________________   involves thinking about the unwanted emotional experience or object in such a way to change its emotional meaning.","Before we begin, one last reminder of the definition of each strategy:

I then went through all the black poof stuff which was waist high. There were people dressed in black above reaching towards you.""
