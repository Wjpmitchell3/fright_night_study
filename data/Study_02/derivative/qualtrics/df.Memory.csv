I liked this one a lot because we culd see into all the old prison cells but I think that distracted me from the actors themselves. there was also a loud shaking box and I think someone was inside of it slamming on it but this was definitel the loudest haunted house ou of all of them. we had to go up and don steps in this one and the ground like slipped under you at one pouint and I remember that because I almost ate it after someone JUMPED OUT AT ME he really got my heart rate going I think. ut it was cool how you could choose the last part which to go through and the koleidescope hall had all the abandoped cells in it. I cant really remember a lot of the actors in this one though but I had the most jump scares in this part of eastern state it was super awesome. ","5","Large Monsters over Railing"

She asked what limbs we wanted to give up before entering. I wanted to make a joke and raise my arm, but I didn't. No one else said anything before we were let in. I don't remember much about the shop itself, it all seems to blur. But I remember people with red jumpsuits being at our sides, holding axes or hammers. I was swearing a lot as people scared at me, and more than once the actors would say that I should watch my tongue or they would rip it out. There was a crushing machine with gore in it and someone escorting us into it. After that, there was a man on a scaffold that slammed it down as we walked below him.

It started with us walking into a bus with skeletons that had head wounds. I remember really being intrigued by the design of the skeletons and the lay out of the bus. Some time after we left the bus we walked through an area of cells containing robots in several grotesque and painful positions shaking and jerking violently. Here someone ran right through the cell and that really shook me because I thought all the cells were hard metal cages. There was also a box in a cage hat rattled and jerked towards the end of this section. Somewhere there were bodies hanging down from the ceiling as well and there was only one person in that section. There was a sliding floor section as well and that was unsettling just because of how unsafe it felt in an environment where you are already on your toes, trying to anticipate the next scare.

The art was reminiscent of a comic or superhero series. There was a woman dancing on the table, and loud music and popping sounds (sorry I am having trouble typing lol) The most notable experience was this tunnel where the walls kept rotating, and as we tried to traverse it, you felt dizzy. The tunnel was dark, and there was neon dots/spots that were disorienting since everything was moving. That was pretty dope. I also remember we had to wear these 3D glasses but they kept falling off, which interrupted my ~viewing experience~ Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this one. ","1","Splatter Paint"

Our group formed a people chain while we walked through because my friend was scared. she grabbed the back of my sweatshirt and i thought that was funny. There was a cool green strobe light thing and a bunch of fog. There was also a bit more of an open hallway at one point and a lot of fog. There were also strobe lights in the really foggy room. I wiggled my arms while walking through so it would look cool. I also snuck up behind my brother when it was dark and scared him. very funny.

Anyways with the Crypt I don't remember too too much unfortunately, I think the other sections stood out a little more.  I think with the Crypt the memories I have are as follows:  there was a room that we entered that was bright and gory, had bodies hung upside down that were moving.  I also remember going up and down floors in the Crypt which was unique compared to the other sections.  One section we went through was a cell block and I remember a box flashing with bright lights and banging around as if something was in it, all inside a cage to the right of the tour, as well as an air blast cannon that hit around my right calf.  There was also a guy running back and forth through the cell's bars which I was kind of amazed as to how he fit through while running so fast, thinking if it were me I'd get stuck or bang my head going through which made me laugh a little.

I remember first walking in and a character swinging a sledge hammer at my girlfriend who was in front of me.  I remembered this most because I was genuinely concerned something was going to happen and I was going to be stepping in.  It was also a shock because I don't remember anything the character looked like outside of a black figure and the sledgehammer.  Afterwards we continued through and I could smell gasoline/exhaust fumes of what I believed to be a chainsaw (I got this from my background with this).  Immediately after smelling this we stepped outside and a shorter woman bent over came running up the ramp towards the inside revving a chainsaw.  Afterwards we continued on back inside of another building and I remember walking around and through some box where a guy scared us in then came right back around and scared us coming out.  I remember this cause again, it was a jump scare right in my girlfriend's face so I thought I was going to get defensive and then the character started laughing saying ""I got you didn't I"" and she responded ""yeah you did"" and he kept repeating this and them going back and forth saying he really got her and she said yes you did.  Then there was also a table saw somewhere in this section where someone's hand had been chopped off.  I remember it being the darkest overall of the exhibits in terms of lighting throughout, if there was any light at all it was a pale white LED rather than bright lights like delirium, golden lights like in Take 13, and a mixture of both golden lights with just more colorful content (i.e. gory blood-soaked or items, people, etc.) throughout the Crypt.","1","Chainsaw"
