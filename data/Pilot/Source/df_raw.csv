She is essentially the introduction lady who lays down the rules and tells you not to curse, touch the actors, etc. She was dressed in a nurse's outfit with blood on it, and kept saying that we were never going to return from the haunted house. Also, she had an accomplice that came from some hole in the wall that talked to the audience too.

There was a guy with a chainsaw and what I particularly remember about him is that he got really close to the patrons. I was actually scared he actually may hit someone with it.

I thought were were safe from the actors here but of course I was wrong.

There was a person on a gurney and someone behind it. One of them, covered in bloody gauze, approached me. At first they were behind me, then were by my side and then, crawling on the ground below me near my left foot. ",Crawling bloody person,"There was a guard character standing near a computer screen in a mock control room. The theme of the room was the alarms going off because the infection had begun. The computer was broken, the screen was just blue with an error message and the actor was out of character, kinda laughing with us about how it was not working. ",Technical difficulties,"I accidentally made eye contact with a clown performer. There were at least four of them in the room, I remember seeing one in each corner and being surprised because usually the actors were more spread out but here they seemed like they were everywhere. She had high pig tails and scary make-up but I didn't look at her face, I looked down at her long polka dot dress and stockings. She asked me if I liked clowns and called me a ""terrible liar"" when I said yes.",Terrible liar,"A male person with scary white contacts was behind bars, shaking at them and reaching out to try and touch people. Chains rattled around him and when he reached out at me, I recoiled against the wall and said ""please don't touch me!"" and surprised myself because I didn't think his intentions were to touch me, just to scare me into thinking he would. He later moved out from behind the cage, showing that it was just an act and he could in fact ""escape"" at any time. ",Fake cage,"In the dark hall with the smoke and lasers there were a lot of dark hooded figures walking around not being especially scary. You couldn't see their faces and they all seemed very tall to me. They milled about and didn't approach anyone. I don't know how effective they were at being scary in the context of the haunted house but they were different compared to all the other actors- most of whom had select phrases and tricks. ",Dark tall figures,"A man at the entrance of one of the sections was chatting with us before entering. He had a fake German accent and was a zombie guard. He told us how the monsters might not respect the glow stick around the necks and could be bad monsters and forget about the rules and come after us or get us separated from each other. Before we walked in, he laughed about monster rats to the left and made me paranoid about fake rodents crawling around at my feet.",Rats,"There was a patient strapped to a metal bed and someone in a bloody smock/doctor's apron talking about sacrificing our body parts. He said ""give us your ears!"" In a later part of the same room, someone was asking for teeth. I remember thinking ears was too silly and not scary enough, while the idea of harvesting teeth and the decor of a demented dentist's office had me creeped out. ",Ears and teeth,"There was an actor strapped to a human slingshot kinda apparatus. They were standing on a platform and would jump down, then the stretchy rubber bands attached to the persons arms pulled them back to the spot. The actor was in a straight jacket, I think with a mask covering the lower part of their face. There was another actor nearby, I guess just to be a spotter or maybe help with the timing or with the instrument. It was the only acrobatic performance. I thought it could have been scarier but I did remember thinking it seemed like fun to fling yourself towards scared people. ",Straight jacket sling shot,"In the blacklight room there was someone I caught moving back into their original position to hide and scare people. They were in an all black suit with colorful polka dots and hid against the corner. They were camouflaged. Since the timing was off, they didn't try to scare me and waited for the next group of victims.
